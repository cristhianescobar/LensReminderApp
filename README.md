Contact Lens Notifier Free (Available on Google Play)

In the summer of 2012, while I was interning at Halliburton I got together with another intern and developed this application in 4 weeks, both without prior experience with the android API. The differentiator in our application was the fact that even after powering off the device, it will still remember without even opening the application again when was a good approximate time to change your contact lenses. At the time we were the only free version that did that.
